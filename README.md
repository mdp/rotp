# The Ruby One Time Password Library

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mdp/rotp.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mdp/rotp)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/rotp.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/rotp)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/mdp/rotp/blob/master/LICENSE)

A ruby library for generating one time passwords (HOTP & TOTP) according to [RFC 4226](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) and [RFC 6238](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).

ROTP is compatible with the [Google Authenticator](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator) available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) and [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/google-authenticator/id388497605).

Many websites use this for [multi-factor authentication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17rykTIX_HY), such as GMail, Facebook, Amazon EC2, WordPress, and Salesforce. You can find the whole [list here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator#Usage).

## Dependencies

* OpenSSL
* Ruby 1.9.3 or higher

## Installation

```bash
gem install rotp
```

## Library Usage

### Time based OTP's

```ruby
totp = ROTP::TOTP.new("base32secret3232")
totp.now # => "492039"

# OTP verified for current time
totp.verify("492039") # => true
sleep 30
totp.verify("492039") # => false
```

Optionally, you can provide an issuer which will be used as a title in Google Authenticator.

```ruby
totp = ROTP::TOTP.new("base32secret3232", issuer: "My Service")
totp.provisioning_uri("alice@google.com")
```

### Counter based OTP's

```ruby
hotp = ROTP::HOTP.new("base32secretkey3232")
hotp.at(0) # => "260182"
hotp.at(1) # => "055283"
hotp.at(1401) # => "316439"

# OTP verified with a counter
hotp.verify("316439", 1401) # => true
hotp.verify("316439", 1402) # => false
```
### Activate TOTP single usage

By default, a token cannot be discarded when used, it only expires after 30 seconds. Therefore, it can be used multiple times before expiring, creating a security risk. See [this issue](https://github.com/mdp/rotp/issues/44) for more information.

To prevent this behaviour, you can set up a cache and store an uid for the token. At this time an [implementation exists in Redis](https://github.com/PredicSis/rotp-redis)

Note: TOTP is conforms to [RFC 6238 - section 5.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238#section-5.2)

*"The verifier MUST NOT accept the second attempt of the OTP after
the successful validation has been issued for the first OTP, which
ensures one-time only use of an OTP."*

### Generating a Base32 Secret key

```ruby
ROTP::Base32.random_base32  # returns a 16 character base32 secret. Compatible with Google Authenticator
```

Note: The Base32 format conforms to [RFC 4648 Base32](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base32#RFC_4648_Base32_alphabet)

### Google Authenticator Compatible URI's

Provisioning URI's generated by ROTP are compatible with the Google Authenticator App
to be scanned with the in-built QR Code scanner.

```ruby
totp.provisioning_uri("alice@google.com") # => 'otpauth://totp/issuer:alice@google.com?secret=JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP'
hotp.provisioning_uri("alice@google.com", 0) # => 'otpauth://hotp/issuer:alice@google.com?secret=JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP&counter=0'
```

This can then be rendered as a QR Code which can then be scanned and added to the users
list of OTP credentials.

#### Working example

Scan the following barcode with your phone, using Google Authenticator

![QR Code for OTP](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=qr&chs=250x250&chl=otpauth%3A%2F%2Ftotp%2Falice%40google.com%3Fsecret%3DJBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP)

Now run the following and compare the output

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'rotp'
totp = ROTP::TOTP.new("JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP")
p "Current OTP: #{totp.now}"
```

### Testing

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec rspec
```

## Executable Usage

Once the rotp rubygem is installed on your system, you should be able to run the `rotp` executable
(if not, you might find trouble-shooting help [at this stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/a/909980)).

```bash
# Try this to get an overview of the commands
rotp --help

# Examples
rotp --secret p4ssword                       # Generates a time-based one-time password
rotp --hmac --secret p4ssword --counter 42   # Generates a counter-based one-time password
```
